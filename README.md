### Libraries Used

All libraries versions used are listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/prakhar-ai/InstantMD/blob/main/requirements.txt)

### Approach Used

Our NLP approach uses both text and sentence tokenization.

**No third party NLP libraries were used for the project and all pattern matching was done through Regex**

This helps us serve results instantly as opposed to using popular libraries like nltk or spacy, giving us the name **InstantMD**. We preserving sentence structure while also searching the tokenized words. We can then extract symptoms using a list of [symptom keywords](https://github.com/prakhar-ai/InstantMD/blob/main/symptom_list.txt) and the chief complaint by matching with the part of the anatomy that the patient is experiencing symptoms in. This is done through the [anatomy keywords](https://github.com/prakhar-ai/InstantMD/blob/main/anatomy_list.txt). Other factors are similarly extracted using keywords and rules designed by us and implemented through Regex. 

## Problem Statement
### Abstract
Being able to have machines understand unstructured textual content already plays a big part nowadays in our life. NLP can contribute largely to the advancement of medical science. NLP is used to extract information from free text narratives written by a variety of healthcare providers. Here we approach natural language processing algorithm where we

* Evaluate the free text and compare it with the dataset of NLP Dictionary.
* Annotated the important textual content from the text like Medication, Investigation (Pathology, Radiology), Chief Complaint.
* After Segregation the highlighted data should automatically enter the flow of EMR.

### Problem Definition
To develop a solution, the first step is to understand the problem. Develop an NLP module to identify the keywords related to a patient's investigation, medication and chief complaint from a free text in the text box. Highlight the extracted content and feed them as input in EMRâ€™s Chief complaint, Investigation and Medication module.
